# Snipe

Source code to my most recent Minecraft name sniper that I developed. Heavily modified and improved version of the sniping program that Clover used for a period of time. However, since the sniping game has evolved since then, I cannot confirm that the sniper will have as high of a success rate as it did back then.

The last I thing I can recall whilst working on this sniper was adding proxy support. I can't exactly remember if I was ever to get it working or not. So, if you are a developer and are interested in fixing that, go ahead.



Anyone is free to use this sniper, however you cannot claim the code as your own (that's just weird if you do)
